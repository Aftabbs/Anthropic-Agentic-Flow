# Anthropic Exploration: Customer Care ChatBot

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b6b9b61-4774-4bfd-bd75-93ba2de24990)


This project explores various capabilities of Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model by building a customer care ChatBot. The ChatBot leverages a simulated database (fake DB) to provide contextually relevant responses, helping users with their inquiries. During this project, several key techniques and features were implemented, including:

- **Working with API Basic Requests**
- **Multimodal Requests**
- **Effective Prompting**
- **Prompt Caching**
- **Tool Use (Function Calling)**

Each segment of the project demonstrates a unique aspect of working with Anthropic’s APIs and models.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a customer care ChatBot that not only answers queries but also provides suggestions by referring to a simulated database. Powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, the ChatBot integrates several cutting-edge techniques to ensure efficient and context-aware communication. The project serves as a proof of concept for advanced API interactions and demonstrates how multimodal capabilities, prompt engineering, caching, and function calling can be combined to build a robust solution.

## Key Work Segments

### 1. Working with API Basic Requests

**What was done:**  
- Integrated basic HTTP requests to communicate with Anthropic’s API endpoints.
- Implemented standard authentication and error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable communication.

**Explanation:**  
This segment focused on understanding and working with the fundamentals of API interactions. By establishing a baseline for making API calls, we ensured that the ChatBot could reliably send and receive data from the Anthropic LLM endpoints.

---

### 2. Multimodal Requests

**What was done:**  
- Extended the API requests to support multimodal inputs, allowing the ChatBot to process different types of data.
- Experimented with combining text with other modalities to see how the model responds to richer contexts.

**Explanation:**  
Multimodal requests enable the ChatBot to handle more than just text. This segment explored the potential of using additional input types, enhancing the contextual awareness of the ChatBot. Although the focus remained on text for customer support, this work paves the way for future enhancements like image or audio integration.

### 3. Effective Prompting

**What was done:**  
- Crafted carefully designed prompts to guide the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model for accurate and context-aware responses.
- Iterated over multiple prompt variations to determine which formulations yield the best results.

**Explanation:**  
Effective prompting is crucial for obtaining high-quality outputs from language models. By experimenting with prompt structures and wording, we learned how to instruct the model more clearly. This resulted in responses that are not only accurate but also aligned with the context provided by the fake database.

### 4. Prompt Caching

**What was done:**  
- Implemented a caching mechanism to store prompt-response pairs.
- Reduced latency and API usage by reusing responses for repeated or similar queries.

**Explanation:**  
Prompt caching plays an important role in optimizing performance and reducing API costs. By storing and reusing responses, the system avoids unnecessary API calls for similar queries. This segment shows how caching can improve both the efficiency and responsiveness of the ChatBot.

### 5. Tool Use (Function Calling)

**What was done:**  
- Utilized Anthropic’s function calling capabilities to interact with our fake database.
- Enabled the ChatBot to perform lookups and extract relevant information from the DB to inform its responses.

**Explanation:**  
Integrating function calling allows the ChatBot to extend its capabilities beyond simple text generation. By querying the simulated database, the model can provide more specific and actionable customer support answers. This integration demonstrates a practical approach to blending dynamic data retrieval with advanced language modeling.

## Project Architecture

1. **API Interaction:**  
   The core of the project is built around robust API interactions with Anthropic’s endpoints. This includes making basic requests, handling errors, and processing multimodal inputs.

2. **Prompt Engineering:**  
   Effective prompts are designed to elicit accurate responses from Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Different prompting strategies were tested and refined throughout the project.

3. **Caching Mechanism:**  
   A caching layer stores prompt-response pairs to improve performance and reduce repeated API calls.

4. **Tool Integration:**  
   The function calling mechanism is integrated to query a fake database, enabling the ChatBot to provide context-specific answers.

5. **ChatBot Logic:**  
   The overall logic combines API interactions, prompt engineering, and tool use to create an intelligent customer care assistant.
